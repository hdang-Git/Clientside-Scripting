                    <p>
                        Coming into this class, I can say that I've had little experience with html/css & javascript. The only time I really started looking into front-end development
                        was probably around my sophomore year of college when I wanted to pick up a few skills to create a website for myself which didn't really take off. However that was a 
                        lifetime ago, so I don't really remember what I did before. In today's industry, I see being able to develop sites for the web are important due to its demand
                        and versatility.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="labHeading">CSS Techniques Utilized: </h3>
                    <p>                        
                        The advanced CSS techniques that were utilized for this application were rounded corners on the images and container. For the image, a box shadow was implemented with a 
                        gradient for blur effect. Also for body background, a gradient color was applied from top left to bottom right.

                    <h2 class="labList"> Lab 2: Advanced Layout (no Bootstrap) </h2>
                    <p>For this week's lab, the aspects that I found easy were the virtual paging and the forms. 
                    One of the harder aspect that I struggled with was the responsive design using media queries where 
                    I had to play around a lot with making it both mobile and desktop friendly. 
                    It was especially hard in getting the images to line up under each other in a mobile view 
                    by setting the width to 100% while changing that to a smaller value in a desktop view. Likewise 
                    for the navigation bar to hide and show the hamburger menu upon shrinking.
                    In fact, it was definitely an interesting study in JQuery since it's my first time using it. 
                    Another aspect of difficulty was getting the text area change dynamically so I wrote some Javascript 
                    code to modify column size depending on the window size since we just learned some JS this week.</p>

                    <!--Lab3 -->
                    <h2 class="labList"> Lab 3 & 4: JavaScript Intro (JS Framework) & Advanced Javascript (No jQuery) Lab </h2>
                    <p>In this lab, I had to create a framework of my choosing of which I chose to be about the solar system.
                    The aspect of the lab that I found easy was being able to instantiate the object using my framework's 
                    constructor. Another easy part was handling different javascript events.
                    Of course though the harder features to implement was the calculations for figuring out the circular path 
                    of the planetary orbits. Earlier on, I had tried to implement CSS3 features that would be integrated into
                    the framework so as to have rotational spins of individual planets and maybe a 3d representation. Unfortunately 
                    a simple implementation without importing libraries couldn't be found. Apart from that, it took me a while to 
                    implement resizing so when the screen is resized, it should still retain the animation for the planets. 
                    Another challenge was getting the orbits to line up exactly with the planets by having a canvas overlay the 
                    div containing the planets. Also a stretch goal that I accomplished unrelated to the framework but in js was 
                    that I managed to implement mp3 audio to play in the background when the image button is clicked. 
                    I definitely had fun in this lab and maybe got a little carried away with implementing features.
                    I think that if I had more time, I would have tried to add the option of seeing it in 3d. Also if I had more
                    time, I definitely would have recalculated the orbits using Kepler's laws which relates the planet's periodic 
                    motion to its radius from a Newtonian perspective.</p>

                    <p>For this lab I learned how to create a database using mysql workbench. I also learned how to force errors onto the
                        database software along with database concepts. I also learned about the intricacies with things such as 
                        tunneling in depending on your connection

                    <h2 class="labList"> Lab 6: Web API Lab  </h2>
                    <p> In this lab, I connected to the backend and created a Web API which I used. Setting up the connections and the prepared statements 
                        was pretty easy for me considering my recent experience with it. The only major problem in the lab that I had 
                        was with the Cross Origin Resource Sharing which prevented me from getting data. In order to bypass this I had 
                        to install a plugin. Also I had to change the ajax timeout to 6 seconds. Another difficult part of the project
                        for me was learning jquery to display the table. Aside from all of that, it was a very interesting project.
